# Hidden-Information

## ABOUT

**Hidden Information** is a Chrome extension designed to analyze webpage Document Object Model (DOM) elements for the presence of deceptive designs known as Dark Patterns. This extension helps users identify manipulative tactics that can mislead them into making unintended choices or purchases.

## WHAT ARE DARK PATTERNS?

Dark patterns are deceptive design strategies used to manipulate user behavior and influence how they interact with software. While some dark patterns may be innocuous—such as highlighting sign-up buttons to draw attention—others can be significantly more problematic. In online shopping contexts, dark patterns can push users toward purchasing items they don’t need or want, ultimately leading to a frustrating user experience.

## FEATURES

- Analyzes webpage DOM for potential dark patterns.
- Provides insights to help users navigate online environments more safely.
